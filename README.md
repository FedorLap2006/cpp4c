# cpp4c
This is a small library to provide functions and data structures similar to those found in libstdc++.
It is not by any means is, or going to be complete, as not everything can be implemented in C.

> [!CAUTION] 
> This is a very old, unmainained branch that contains a lot of broken code. I might get around to fixing it someday. But for intents and purposes, please refer to `master` instead.
