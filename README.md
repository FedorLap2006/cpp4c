# cpp4c
This is a small library to provide functions and data structures similar to those found in libstdc++.
Please note, this is not, by any means, a complete substitute, just a collection of some things I found useful to have in C as well.

> [!CAUTION] 
> This is a very old, unmainained branch that contains a lot of broken code. I might get around to fixing it someday. But for intents and purposes, please refer to `master` instead.
